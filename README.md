# Imagica
A image generation model from scratch (Due to inavailability of computer units, the model may not get trained efficiently, but research suggest that around 1000 epochs could generate better result)
## Resources
- This great video by [Outlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoKDTa5jHvg&t=1338s) gives a great indepth explaination of the math behind Diffusion Model as it went through different approaches and paper implementations.
## Future Improvement Scope
- Residual connections
- Different activation functions like SiLU, GWLU, ...
- BatchNormalization
- GroupNormalization
- Attention Layers
